		<h1>To Love & Hate a Place</h1>
		<h2>Harrison Hong</h2>
		
		<p>Often the places we have the strongest feelings about are the ones that we have lived in the longest. I believe in this statement so wholeheartedly that I think if you don’t have anything you despise about the place you call home, then you probably haven’t lived there long enough yet. But that’s not to say that these strong feelings must be ones of resentment. In fact, the feelings of love and pride for a place can also take time to develop and grow. These two feelings of love and hate for a place seem to be opposing at first but upon closer inspection, are actually very related things.</p>

		<p>As individuals, we can only speak on our own experiences, our own places that we’ve loved and hated. I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and therefore it was the place that taught me how to love and hate a home. St. Louis is a place that is as much shaped by its friendly people and charming, unique neighborhoods as it is by the forces of institutional racism and a deep class divide. It is a place that first showed me the humanity in others and the love that community can provide. But it is also the place that showed me what it means to be an <em>other</em> and just how deeply rooted that feeling can be within a people and within a place. I love St. Louis, and sometimes I think it’s beautiful. I also hate St. Louis, and it constantly finds ways to disappoint me. These contradictory truths are not unique to me. They are held by all kinds of people for all kinds of places.</p>
		
		<p>My goal with this project is to examine the connection between loving and hating a place. To do this, I look at various sources we have read in class and some outside examples that I have chosen. I am not looking for any big answers. I am merely exploring what ties exist between love and hate of a place in each of these sources. I hope that you enjoy looking through this project and that maybe it makes you ruminate on your own feelings towards a particular place in your own life.</p>

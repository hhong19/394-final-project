		<h1>The Nation-Family</h1>
		<h2>Tamar Shirinian (2018)</h2>
		<p>During Shirinian’s interviews, it seems, at times, that the love these “queer” Armenians have for Armenia is hidden or stowed away under layers of contradictions and frustrations. For many of them, it appears to exist as something latent, not present in the forefront of the mind but hovering in the back. If it exists at all, it is a quiet loyalty that roots them in place. However, for other Armenians this feeling is much more pronounced. It manifests itself as an obligation to their country and causes them to turn their attention to those that they believe are not living properly. One subject, Arev, says:</p>

		<p><strong>“But what’s wrong with that?... She was worried about you. This is why I love Armenia. People are warm!” (49)</strong></p>

		<p>If attention from fellow Armenians can be described as a warmth, then genealogically perverse Armenians experience it as a wet, humid heat. It is the kind of warmth that is inescapable and thick, following you wherever you go, clinging to you in an oppressive and suffocating swelter. This heat destroys both private and public space and judges you at every street corner, market, or public transit. And these Armenians who are considered unorthodox by society are sick of it. Another interviewee, Raffi, explains, “We are tired already. Tired of being told how we’re supposed to act just because we are Armenian” (51). This reproach and delivering of shame makes them feel constantly otherized, so much so, that some of them are willing to go to great length to free themselves from it.</p>

		<p><strong>“I am willing to give up my jobs, everyone that I have ever loved, my friends, my girlfriend, my entire social life, my right to work, my citizenship--everything--for that inner peace” (52)</strong></p>

		<p>This quote comes from Alice, a woman who dreams of leaving everything behind and moving out of Armenia. This trade seems to be an ideal one for many “queer” Armenians, giving them the ability to live out their lives in whatever manner they choose. However upon leaving, some Armenians find their new homes to be “lonely or ‘disconnected’” (56). In fleeing the warmth of other Armenians, they find that they do not like the coldness of the big city as much as they imagined. </p>

		<p>This brings me to a point about the attention that Armenians wield. As annoying and problematic as it is, their nagging comes from a place of love. This love for their fellow Armenian, their kinfolk of the nation-family, is ultimately what creates the hate that genealogically perverse Armenians have for their country. The overstepping of boundaries in order to enforce an ideal of what Armenians should be and what is proper is, in itself, a love of an image and a concern for those who are not abiding by it. Unorthodox Armenians who do not fit this image still love Armenia because it is their home and its people are their family. But, they hate it for that same closeness which refuses to accept them for who they are. It is a whirling storm of emotions, blowing them away and then bringing them back, making them miss Armenia and then reminding them why they left in the first place.</p>

		<p>Yet, maybe there is a way to have the best of both worlds: to have the warmth of Armenians and the space for one’s own individuality. Armen, who goes out of his way to challenge other Armenians on their critiques, seems to be aiming for this. By helping others to understand him, he is actively trying to change what he hates about Armenia through his love for it and its people. To find a place that you can love and which allows you to fully love yourself, that must be what an ideal home is.</p>

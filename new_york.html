		<p>I always find myself listening to this song in airports. I don’t know if it’s the melancholy tone or the deeply seeded angst, but something about it really soothes me while I’m wandering around the different gates. I love how tangible the lyrics are with its rats, bored cops, and neighborhood bars. I love how pessimistic yet glowing the instruments are, unraveling at every turn like a sad and comedic poem. Song writer James Murphy’s ballad is a love letter and a striking indictment all at once.</p>

		<p>So much of this song feels like a strained relationship that someone just can’t break off from. Murphy smashes the idyllic, dream version of New York that is so often portrayed in films. He sings about the dirty and corrupt parts of the city, showcasing some of the worst things New York has to offer. Yet, he can’t seem to stop loving it. The ugly and terrible aspects of the city have become baked into its charm. He is pulled into the allure of New York regardless of how awful it is or how many times it may beat him down. Murphy laments:</p>

		<p><strong>“But you’re still the one pool where I’d happily drown”</strong></p>

		<p>In the end, this is the sentiment that remains. New York without its flaws would no longer be New York. As much as he may hate certain things about the city, if they were not there, he wouldn’t love the city in the same way. Murphy is ensnared in the city and its imperfections. Part of him seems to think that New York has changed too much and that it is no longer the place he once knew, singing, “Take me off your mailing list. For kids who think it still exists.” Nevertheless, he can’t detach himself from the city. Even if the New York of the past is gone, he can’t help but still love it. He’ll always have the fortune and doom of being in love with New York City.</p>

		<p>Airports are places of transition where people are always arriving or departing. I think it’s that sensation of in betweenness that makes me associate them with this song. It lives in the transition between love and hate and the balance between both of these forces. So as I look around at the people in the bustling airport, I wonder where they’re going and where they’re coming from, and I imagine all the places that they must love and hate.</p>

		<p>It would not be an overstatement to say that this is one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen. Sweeping and grand yet intimate and warm, its cinematography is beautiful to behold. If you want to experience that before reading this, I highly recommend you do that first. I will be going into light spoilers here, nothing too revealing, but if you want a truly fresh viewing, then go watch it and come back later.</p>

		<P>Jimmie’s love/hate relationship with San Francisco is central to the film and easy to understand on a surface level. Jimmie wants to return to the part of San Francisco that his family used to live in, but he can’t since his family was priced out of the neighborhood. It would be simple to set this up as just a movie about gentrification. However, what makes the film special is its decision to focus on Jimmie’s love for one particular house. In doing this, the effects of gentrification are able to be seen on a smaller and more personal level.</p>

		<p>Jimmie longs for this old house in which his family used to live. He loves this house so much that he tries to maintain it even though it’s no longer his, much to the chagrin of the house’s current white owners. For Jimmie, the house represents a lost dream. It is a symbol of stability and something that he sees as tying him to the roots of his past. When Jimmie looks at the house, he sees a future that could have been, and maybe if he works hard enough, one that he can make a reality.</p>

		<p>As much as Jimmie loves the house, the relationship at the heart of this film is the one between him and his best friend, Mont. Their friendship carries a lot of the emotional weight of the story and exists as a wonderful subversion of masculinity and a depiction of black male vulnerability. Jimmie’s love for Mont connects him to the city of San Francisco. They confide in each other their hopes for the future and disillusionments about the present, providing a lens through which the viewer experiences the city as they skateboard together through its hilly streets.</p>

		<p>Ultimately this is a movie about belonging. It examines who gets to control or own space and how someone reacts when that space is taken away. There is a real feeling that the city of San Francisco has been stolen from its black residents, that the people who have taken it have an illegitimate claim to power built upon the work and history of people they have now driven out. The result is a tension that builds inside of Jimmie. He wants to stay in San Francisco for his family and friends and his loyalty to his home. However, he can’t help but feel like San Francisco doesn’t want him back. There’s no opportunity there for him, no future where he can feel like he truly belongs. There is an earned quality to Jimmie’s hate for San Francisco, described best when he sees two young women on the bus complaining about the city and tells them:</p>

		<p><strong>“You don’t get to hate San Francisco. You don’t get to hate it unless you love it.”</strong></p>

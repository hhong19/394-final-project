		<p>It’s easy to categorize Ivo as a person whose life is stuck in the past. The pictures around his home remind him of his family and of happier times. He lives alone except for his neighbor and friend Margus, a wholesome tangerine farmer. However, to only have this perspective of Ivo would be selling him short. Ivo is much more complicated than that. He talks to Niko about life after the war, saying that he and Ahmed will come see him perform in a play. Whether he’s being serious about this is another question, but regardless, Ivo still has dreams of the future and the hope that maybe one day life will be good again. Adding to this complexity is the fact that Ivo is a hard-to-read man. His guests try to question him and pry into his shell but they are never able to get a great answer from him. When asked why he still stays in Abkhazia, Ivo responds:</p>

		<p><strong>“I love it, and I hate it.”</strong></p>

		<p>Ivo has understandably contradictory feelings towards Abkhazia. On one hand, he loves it for being his home and for the memories he must have of it. At one point, the film seems to imply that he remains there to protect his son’s grave, but it is never explicitly stated. If we follow this interpretation, it appears that his son's death is related to both his love and hate of Abkhazia. After all, the hate Ivo has for his home comes from his hatred of the war, a war that took his son from him and resulted in the rest of his family fleeing to Estonia. His relationship with Abkhazia is so arduous because it pulls him in and pushes him away at the same time; he is held back and tied to the land by the very thing that makes him want to escape.</p>

		<p>Nevertheless, I think what sets <em>Tangerines</em> apart is its focus on people rather than place. What drives Ivo’s hospitality is not a loyalty to any nation but a respect for humanity. Ivo’s real love is not for any particular place but for people. Ivo’s feelings about place are complicated because ultimately people make up places and people are complex. It is the very love and loyalty that these people have to a place that leads them to killing others for what? For pride? Nationalism? The sake of land? Their love is used for hate. This folly is what makes Ivo so disillusioned. As much as he wants to believe in the good within people and the humanity that is central to his ethos, the war and killing continues, and his fellow men keep dying. Ivo, sitting amongst his guests and the sweet Margus, proposes a toast to death: the one who makes him wish he was somewhere else and who makes him want to remain at home.</p>

		<h1>Wedded to the Republic</h1>
		<h2>Esra Özyürek (2006)</h2>

		<p><strong>“We were not in search of the Turkish identity” (79)</strong></p>

		<p>This quote from the exhibit curator, Zafer Toprak, didn’t sit right with me when I first read this chapter and still didn’t feel right upon a revisit. The reason for this is the dissonance between his view of the exhibit and how it is seen by the visitors. Through Toprak’s artistic decisions, his love for Turkey is evidently one based on a dream of modernization and westernization. He even mentions how the whole reason for the exhibit is to get the public ready for joining the EU, a motive tinged with a feeling of inadequacy (79). Toprak claims detachment from a search for Turkish-ness, and yet the Turkish identity is exactly what viewers of the exhibit find in it.</p>

		<p>The chapter uses parental metaphors when discussing the relationship between Turkish citizens and the state. Talking about the visitors, Özyürek says, “the exhibits reminded them not of a voluntary love affair between equals, but of their obligation to the founding father who arranged a fitting marriage for them” (80). The love that the visitors had for the past Turkish Republic and for Atatürk is largely felt in this sense of obligation and gratitude. In fact, the love and hate dynamic on display can be split between two Turkeys: past and present. Seeing the photos in the exhibit made visitors nostalgic for Atatürk’s leadership and the more authoritative guiding force of the old Turkish Republic (84). This stands in great contrast to how they felt about the current Turkish government.</p>

		<p>If the visitors see Atatürk’s republic as a strong, protective father, the present republic could be understood as more of a negligent stepdad in their eyes. Many of them complained about the failings and chaos that the move towards democracy brought to Turkey. They see the multi-party system as one of dysfunction and yearn for the steady decisiveness that the past government had along with the unity that it enforced. Like a child of divorce in a family drama movie, the Republican Turks rebuke the current government in a “you’re not my <em>real</em> dad!” kind of fashion. They miss their old dad, the one who used to tuck them in at night and whisper to them about the promise of the Republic.</p>

		<p><strong>“Atatürk did not found the Republic so that Sultanahmet Köftecisi [a historical meatball restaurant] would be replaced by McDonalds” (90)</strong></p>

		<p>I think the tour guides of the exhibit showcase this simultaneous love and hate of Turkey very well. As they take the school kids around, they try to pass down their love of Atatürk and old Republican ideals as well as their disdain for the rise of the liberal economy. Some of them deliberately do not show the “Economic Awakening” section of the tour and speak ill of international corporations, hence the quote about traditional restaurants being lost. Much akin to the parental metaphor that the chapter uses for the state, this love of Turkey’s past and the hatred of its present are both inherited ideas, given from one generation to the next. The two opposing feelings spurn one another. With every step towards democracy that Turkey takes, the Republican love and nostalgia for the old ways and for Atatürk only grows. As they walk around the exhibit, they feel a great pride in the Republic of the past and shame in what it has become. The old Turkey now only exists in photographs, and the visitors imagine the disappointment their father would have if he saw the nation now. Perhaps, in the heritage of love and hate of a place, there is no greater sorrow than that.</p>
